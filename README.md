# Denzel's Neovim Config
My neovim config after my "doomemacs era". The directory structure is still a mess. Probably alot of stuff are done wrong (like setting keybinds etc) but hey, if it works it works.

# Why use X?
It's probably because I want to replicate the stuff that I use alot while in doomemacs like Magit.

# Shoutout
Big shoutout to TJ DeVries, especially his [Advent of Neovim videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep05UYkc6wTyBe7kPjQFWVXTlhKeQejM) that helps me config without copy and pasting blindly.
